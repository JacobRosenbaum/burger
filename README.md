# Welcome to my Burger App!
This is my first ever full stack application, and I am very proud to have completed it!

### Functinality
The app doesn't do a whole lot. You are prompted to write down a burger that you would like to eat, when you click "Burger-Me" the burger pops up under "Burgers." You can either eat it, and it wil switch over to the "Devour" section, or you can throw it away and it will be deleted. I utilized the MVC file structure to organize my app. When you type in your burger on the front-end, it connects to a a database using MySQL. After the apprpriate changes have been made to the database on the back-end, it connects back to the front-end to either create, delete or update (devour). 

### Technologies
I used VS Code to create the front end. I used JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and handlebars. On the back-end I used MySQL to create the database.
